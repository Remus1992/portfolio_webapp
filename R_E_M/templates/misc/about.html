            <p>I was born and raised in Klamath Falls, Oregon. When I was 10, my family moved out to the countryside and
                two of my passions developed from having long open roads spreading off in every direction: cross country
                running and cycling. </p>

            <p>I also spent a lot of time outdoors with my Boy Scout Troop where I attained the rank of Eagle Scout
                (within two weeks of my 18th birthday much to my parentâ€™s chagrin). </p>

            <p>Academically, I competed in Chess Tournaments from the fourth grade all the way through high school where
                I also picked up Mathematics Competitions (where I competed at the state level for Calculus as a
                senior). </p>

            <p>After graduating high school, I studied at Claremont McKenna College in Southern California. I started
                out in Biology thinking I wanted to go to Medical School but changed my mind deciding I wanted to pursue
                film instead. I promptly changed to Literature where I got to learn the foundations of story structure
                from a classics perspective (something I take into account every time I start a story). Although I toyed
                with going to film school, I ultimately decided I wanted to approach the industry from the independent
                film market and bought my first camera, the Canon T3. From there, I took thousands of shots and random
                videos before moving on to the Canon T3i, then the Canon 6D, followed by the Canon 5D Mark III, and
                finally have settled on the Sony a7RIII.</p>

            <p>Although I am still very passionate about film, I found myself getting drawn more and more to the
                technical sides of things during my editing process. How did facial recognition work with Photoshop and
                those sorts of things. So, I decided to quit my job and take a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp
                through PDXCodeGuild in Portland, Oregon (where I now reside). I graduated from them in March 2018 and
                became a TA for them immediately afterwards where I got to solidify my skillset. Additionally, I took
                few months to build this portfolio website before I get ready to start their Advanced Javascript
                bootcamp in a few weeks where I intend to master ES6, Node JS, and React.</p>
