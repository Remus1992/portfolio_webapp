            <p>I was born and raised in Klamath Falls, Oregon. When I was 10, my family moved out to the countryside,
                and two of my passions developed from having long open roads spreading off in every direction:
                cross-country running and cycling.</p>

            <p>I also spent a lot of time outdoors with my Boy Scout Troop where I attained the rank of Eagle Scout
                (within two weeks of my 18th birthday much to my parentâ€™s chagrin).</p>

            <p>Academically, I participated in Chess Tournaments from the fourth grade all the way through high school
                where I also picked up Mathematics Competitions (where I competed at the state level for Calculus as a
                senior).</p>

            <p>After graduating high school, I studied at Claremont McKenna College (class of 2014) in Southern
                California. I started out in Biology thinking I wanted to go to Medical School but changed my mind
                deciding I wanted to pursue film instead. I promptly switched to Literature where I got to learn the
                foundations of Story Structure from a classics perspective (something I take into account every time I
                start a story). Although I toyed with going to film school, I ultimately decided I wanted to approach
                the industry from the independent film market and bought my first camera, the Canon T3. From there, I
                took thousands of shots and random videos before moving on to the Canon T3i, then the Canon 6D, followed
                by the Canon 5D Mark III, and finally, have settled on the Sony a7RIII.</p>

            <p>I paid my way through college by way of Army ROTC. I commisioned into the Oregon Army National Guard in
                2014 and spent the next four years with a Forward Support Company (FSC) based out of Medford, OR. My
                first role was as a Maintenance Platoon leader and then eventually moved on to the company's Executive
                Officer. Presently, I am in the process of transferring to a Public Affairs Unit in Salem, Oregon where
                I will make use of my filmmaking & photography skills.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, I am still extremly passionate about film and filmmaking, but I am working towards the coding
                industry. The process of film-editing exposed me to a lot of different kinds of amazing softwares, and I
                found myself getting drawn more and more to the technical sides of things during my editing process. For
                example, I wanted to know how Photoshop's facial recognition worked and those sorts of things. So, I
                decided to quit my job and take a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through PDXCodeGuild in Portland,
                Oregon (where I now reside). I graduated from them in March 2018 and became a TA for them immediately
                afterward where I got to solidify my skillset. Additionally, I took a few months to build this portfolio
                website before I get ready to start their Advanced Javascript Bootcamp in a few weeks where I intend to
                master ES6, Node JS, and React.</p>
